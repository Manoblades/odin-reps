        <li>Toss in some minced garlic as well.</li>
        <li>Wait for the onions and peppers to start getting brown.</li>
        <li>Once they're brown, pour in the alfredo sauce base and the diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add in all of the seasonings and the cheese.</li>
        <li>Add a lot of the "I can't feel my face" pepper flakes. Really drench it.</li>
